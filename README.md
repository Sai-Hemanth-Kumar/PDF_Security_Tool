## PDF Security Tool

Command-line utility to lock (encrypt) and unlock (decrypt) PDF files using passwords. Built with `PyPDF2`.

### Features
- **Lock PDFs**: Encrypt a PDF with a password you choose (with confirmation)
- **Unlock PDFs**: Decrypt a password-protected PDF after verifying the correct password
- **Safe destination handling**: Prompts for a destination file path and warns before overwriting
- **Input validation**: Checks that provided paths are valid `.pdf` files

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyPDF2

Install the dependency:

```bash
pip install PyPDF2
```

### Usage
Run the tool from the project directory:

```bash
python PDF_Security_Tool.py
```

Follow the prompts:
- Choose `lock` or `unlock`
- Enter the source PDF path
  - Example (Windows): `C:\Users\you\Documents\file.pdf`
- For locking, enter and confirm the password
- Provide a destination path for the output PDF (must end with `.pdf`)

#### Examples
- Lock a PDF:
  1) Choose `lock`
  2) Enter: `H:\GitHub_Repositories\PDF_Security_Tool\Sample_Files\Unlock\Sample_Unlock.pdf`
  3) Enter and confirm a password
  4) Provide a destination path, e.g. `C:\Users\you\Desktop\locked.pdf`

- Unlock a PDF:
  1) Choose `unlock`
  2) Enter: `H:\GitHub_Repositories\PDF_Security_Tool\Sample_Files\Lock\Sample_lock.pdf`
  3) Enter the correct password
  4) Provide a destination path, e.g. `C:\Users\you\Desktop\unlocked.pdf`

### Project Structure

‚îú‚îÄ PDF_Security_Tool.py
‚îî‚îÄ Sample_Files/
   ‚îú‚îÄ Lock/
   ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Sample_lock.pdf
   ‚îî‚îÄ Unlock/
      ‚îî‚îÄ Sample_Unlock.pdf
```

### Notes
- If you see "File already exists" when choosing a destination, you can opt to overwrite or re-enter a new path
- For unlocking, if the password is incorrect, the tool will prompt you to try again
- If a file is not encrypted, you will see: "This PDF is already unlocked."

#### Validation and safeguards
- ‚úÖ Accepts only `.pdf` files (rejects folder paths and non-PDF files)
- ‚úÖ Prevents locking an already locked PDF ‚Üí "‚ùå Error: This PDF is already locked."
- ‚úÖ Prevents unlocking an already unlocked PDF ‚Üí "‚ö†Ô∏è This PDF is already unlocked."

### Using the sample files
- `Sample_Files/Unlock/Sample_Unlock.pdf` is an example input for locking.
- `Sample_Files/Lock/Sample_lock.pdf` is an example output of a locked file that you can try to unlock.
